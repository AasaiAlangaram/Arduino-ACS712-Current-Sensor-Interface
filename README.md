# Arduino-ACS712 Current-Sensor Interface

ACS712 - Fully Integrated, Hall Effect-Based Linear Current Sensor. It provide AC or DC Current Sensing. The ouput of the device has a positive slope(>VIOUT(Q)).When Current starts flowing through conductio path from pin 1 to 2 to pin 3 and 4, which is path used for current sensing.
